- have procedure/function that gets a salesperson's customer list
  - make sure this still works when a salesperson's customer list is null
- a customer's transactions, total per transaction, and sum total
- a salesperson's transactions, total per transaction, and sum total, profit per transaction, total profit


NOTE: procedures are like the function we typicalluy work with (do this or that based on input). functions take in input and give an output based on that input (much simpler)

look at code in course dropbox (april 9 class) on student machine for how procedures and functions are written

compiling package
- @hw5pack
- @hw5packbody
- to call function: select hw5pack.funcname(arg) from dual;
